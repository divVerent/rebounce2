===============

A hard level, but you will make it.
Note the gravity!

Hint 1:
Go on, but only step by step. Never
do two steps at once. Otherwise you
will be arrested.

Hint 2:
The upper corners are not too easy.
Find out which switch is the right
one (brings you _DOWN_) and write
it down!

Hint 3:
You can reach a secret level from
here. The lower labyrinths contain
hidden sensors you may be able to
hear. When you have touched all,
the way to the secret level will
be opened.

Hint 4:
This is the last one.
